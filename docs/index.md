# Lyric

## Your Open Worship Superapp

**Lyric** will be your one-stop-shop for making setlists, performing from sheet music with your band, and projecting lyrics with sheet music.
It will have an open and growing ecosystem of federated song libraries.\
We are yet far from this future, but please enjoy the beginnings of the app as-is.
